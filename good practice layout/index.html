           this is an example of a clean organized layout for html. 
            descriptions and examples are placed next to each starting element tag for refernce.


              good practice is to make clean, readable, code that you or someone else can look at and know whats going on.
                structeral tags such as these dont necessarily change the look or feel of the website but are extremely useful not only for readability
                 but also for search engine optimization.


      <header> - the main heading or "top" of the website. generally you only want one of these <header> types.
                  you may have multpile headers, However they cannot be placed within a <footer>,<address> or another <header>.
                    headers typically contain one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>), logos, icons and Author info.
                      when using multiple headers in a <section> for example they should follow a hierarchy fashion.

                   Example
                   
                     h1
                       h2
                          h3
                            h4     - this layout is a best practice for clean readable code.
                          h3
                       h2   
        <nav> - is for a navigation menu ( most web pages have a navigation menu at the top)
        </nav>
      </header> 
      <main> - is the main content of the webite. the content inside here should be uniqe to the document and should not contain
                any content that is reapeated across documents such as sidebars,navigation links,copywrite info,site logos and search forms.
                  There can only be ONE <main> tag in a document and cannot be a descendent of an <article>,<aside>,<footer>,<header> or <nav> element.
        <article> - specifies independent self contained content. exapmles of an article would be forum posts, blog posts, news storys etc..
          <section> - seperates sections of the website. 
            <aside> -  used for content not direclty related to the main content on the page. an example would be an advertisment. 
            </aside>
          </section>
        </article>
      </main>
      <footer> - is just that, the foot or "bottom" of the website. it typically contains Authorship, copywrite, contact, site map,
                   back to top links and related document's
                     note that if you place contact info inside of the footer element it should be placed within an <address> tag.
      </footer>
